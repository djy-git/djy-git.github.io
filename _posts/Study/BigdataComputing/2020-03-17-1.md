# 1. Course Overview
## 1) True course name
Algorithms and Data Structures to deal with Big Data

## 2) What about?
How to process and analyze Big Data in an algorithmic perspective

## 3) Not about
ML, how to use Big Data platforms

## 4) About
CS theory course (data structures, algorithms, discrete math, probability)

## 5) Major topics
- What is Big Data?
- Fundumental problems in Big data
  - Intro to Randomized Algorithms(Quick sort, Min-cut algorithm)
  - Membership problem(Bloom filter)
  - Stream data processing(Frequency estimation, counting problem)
  - Similarity search(Locality-sensitive hashing for high-dimensional data)
- Parallel data processing platforms(Map Reduce, Spark in the theoretical point of view)


# 2. What is Big Data?
**Big Data**  
Broad general term for data sets so large and complex that traditional data processing and storage techniques(traditional RDBMs, deterinistic algo., main memory algo., algorithms running on a single machine) are inadequate  
**Big Data(scalability) $\approx$ Data Science(statistical aspects, accuracy) $\supset$ Maching Learning**

## 1) How Statisticians See Data Science
![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1092/1*mgXvzNcwfpnBawI6XTkVRg.png)[^1]  
In fact, many data scientists are in *Software Development*

## 2) How Computer Scientists See Data Science
![](/images/2020-03-17-1/001.jpg)[^2]  
Math and Statistics don't deliver data science directly, only do it though the algo.(e.g. ML algo.)

## 3) The words keep changing (re-branding)
Data Mining(2000) → **Big Data(2010)** → Data Science(2017)


## 4) V's of Big Data
- **Volume (scale of data)**  
By 2025, the global data will grow to 175ZB(175 * 10$^9$TB)  
300 hours of video to YouTube per minute

- **Velocity (fast generated, streaming data)**  
Modern cars have at least 100 sensors that monitor items

- **Variety (high-dimensional, unstructured)**  
Most of data is not stored at Database  
  - 400 million tweets per day
  - 4 billion hours of video per day
  - 420 million wearable health monitors
  - 30 billion Facebook contents shared per month

- Veracity (high uncertainty)  
Poor data quality costs the US economy around 3.1 trillion USD per year (fake news, social media data)


# 3. What to do with Big Data? 
## 1) Knowledge Extraction from Data
**Data → Information → Knowledge**

- 3 steps are needed for Big Data(Data Science)
1. Stored (Data Engineering)
2. Managed (Data Engineering)
3. Analyzed (Data Mining, Data Engineering, Data Scientist, Data Analyst)

**$\Rightarrow$ Big Data: Data Enginnering and Data Mining technologies particularly for Very Large Data**

## 2) Problems
- Heterogenous data(unstructured, and various format) by multiple sources
- Deterministic algo. → **<u>Randomized algo.(Focus!)</u>**
- Main-memory algo. → External-memory algo. (I/O number matters)
- Storage systems(DBs) → Big data processing platforms(Hadoop, Spark)

## 3) Data Scientist / Data Engineering
- Data Scientist: All + **Math!**
- Data Engineering: All + **System, coding!**
