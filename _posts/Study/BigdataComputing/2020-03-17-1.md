# 1. Course Overview
## 1) True course name
Algorithms and Data Structures to deal with Big Data

## 2) What about?
How to process and analyze Big Data in an algorithmic perspective

## 3) Not about
ML, how to use Big Data platforms

## 4) About
CS theory course (data structures, algorithms, discrete math, probability)

## 5) Major topics
- What is Big Data?
- Fundumental problems in Big data
  - Intro to Randomized Algorithms(Quick sort, Min-cut algorithm)
  - Membership problem(Bloom filter)
  - Stream data processing(Frequency estimation, counting problem)
  - Similarity search(Locality-sensitive hashing for high-dimensional data)
- Parallel data processing platforms(Map Reduce, Spark in the theoretical point of view)


# 2. What is Big Data?
**Big Data**  
Broad general term for data sets so large and complex that traditional data processing and storage techniques(traditional RDBMs, deterinistic algo., main memory algo., algorithms running on a single machine) are inadequate  
Big Data $\approx$ Data Science $\in$ Maching Learning

## 1) The words keep changing (re-branding)
Data Mining(2000) → **Big Data(2010)** → Data Science(2017)
